I tried (and failed) to keep these acknowledgments brief, because I owe every single person here a million words of gratitude.

To my undergraduate advisor Mike McCloskey: You are the reason I pursued cognitive science at all. And ironically, your hallmark work (on intuitive physics) has become a major pillar of my own. Thank you for giving freshman Kim a chance.

Huge thanks to my PhD advisor, Brian Scholl, without whom my entire research career would not have been possible. I will always appreciate his careful eye for detail and the hours he spent building my skills for future research.  There are an uncountable number of lessons that I can’t wait to pass on to my own future students. Thank you to all the members of my committee: Kia Nobre, Nick Turk-Browne, Ilker Yildirim, and Sam McDougle for all the time, advice, and attention they’ve given my work at all different stages. Special thanks to Ilker Yildirim and Sam McDougle for letting me walk into their office whenever I needed advice or assistance, and for entertaining both successful (and failed) research ideas with equal enthusiasm.

To my cohortmates, you all were the best people to spend these 6 years with.  Flora Zhang, I cannot even measure how much I owe you: hours of conversations, delicious meals, shared excitement, shared sorrows, delightful celebrations, artistic explorations... on top of it all, I've seen (and hopefully learned from) your overflowing thoughtfulness and expansive wisdom.  Srishti Goel, regardless of how constantly swamped we are, you take the time to listen, to sympathize, and to motivate us --- you helped me in get through my least motivated days. Marlene Berke, both inside and outside of the lab, you're inspiringly brilliant, hardworking, and selfless. Your energy and drive are invaluable to all of us. Pinar Aldan, your cheer and humor (even when you were stressed) was a central pillar for all of us. All of you have incredible mental strength and persistence, and I'm so honored to call you my friends.

Aalap Shah and Merve Erdogan, you have both been actual models for creativity and research.  Aalap, you're the only one who I can spend 2 hours hashing out some scientific debate, but still walk out of it thinking "I'm glad that happened. In fact, now I understand it better than I did before."  Merve, you light up the soul of everyone in the room.  Your mental fortitude, your openness and warmth, and the way your own intellectual curiosity infects everyone around you (particularly me) is brilliant. 

Thank you to current and past members of the Yale Perception and Cognition Lab, Cognitive and Neural Computation Lab, and the Action, Computation, and Thinking Lab. In lab meetings together, or when I burst into your labs unannounced, I always was greeted with delightful conversation (regardless of whether it was about research or not).  So thank you to Huichao Ji for being the most steadfast collaborator, persistent regardless of any setbacks we encountered, and a sharp careful thinker; Robert Walter, Dawei Bai, and Niels Verosky for lively and bountiful research discussions; Mario Belledone for the hours of enriching research and idea exchanges, and for your patience in helping me understand the world of computational modeling; Wenyan Bi for setting the bar high as my first collaborator at Yale, always providing sharp and articulate reasoning; Hakan Yilmaz for being a patient and incredibly effective educator regardless of the topic; Hanna Hillman for talking about literally anything and everything about the department, work, art, and life; Apoorva Sharma for being such an incredible support, a sanctuary of kindness and warmth regardless the chill of data quality; and of course, to Joan Danielle Ongchoco and Clara Colombatto for being the best lab upperclassmen that anyone could ask for~--- models of academic curiosity, brilliance, compassion, and hard work. 

To my friends outside these labs, at earlier stages of academia than mine --- especially Millie Lawrence, Zihan Wang, Elaine Wang --- thank you for the long warm chats or hours of hot pot and decompressing together that I will always treasure, and definitely want more of. Jihyun Hur, Yamini Pant, Gloria Feng, Eva Wang, Chelsea Uddenberg, and Karen Chen, thank you for being a part of my life, and for letting me part of yours. Here's to many more years. Jessie Duda, your diligence and absolute reliability would make anything we work on (not just Yale Sneak Peek) a rousing success. Sifana Soheil and Amanda Royka, I admire not only both your artistic skills, but also how you spread joy to everyone you spend time around. To Pranava Dhar, it was such an honor to get to advise and mentor a bright student like you, and to learn so much alongside you, but also for the opportunity to see you grow as a researcher.

I owe perhaps the biggest thanks to those who have shaped who I am, including those who knew me in early years before I even knew the term "Cognitive Science", and those who carve out time in their week to think of me, regardless of the number of miles between us. To my childhood friends that I grew up with and have stuck with me through all my insanity (Calvin Hsieh, Marcos Avila, Jacky Zhang), thank you for always being a \textit{home} I can return to, no matter the whirlwind I experience.  To insanely busy (workaholic?) friends (Liang Wang, Ziwei Chen, Anlee Hsiao, Vyshnavi Anandan, Lei Kulpa), thank you for the sense of unceasing care and closeness, regardless of hilariously difficult scheduling across everyone's research and medically-related careers. To those beloved, creative friends (Kiera Wolfe, Joanne Oh, Diana Li), some of the highlights of my life are perhaps the hundreds of hours together tackling mind-bending puzzles and embarking on incredibly memorable imaginative adventures together.  To those wonderful friends I met at conferences (Hong Nguyen, a mastermind of VSS antics and my science sister), met at outside research programs (Miles Martinez, who may have single-handedly enriched both how I think about both science and the art of socialization/conversation), met when I almost detoured into the world of law (Omar Hafez, whose sarcastic humor and reassurance was a buoy in the face of heavy workloads), and to Mitch Martin who really gave that critical support in the final push, thank you. 

All who have been mentioned have kept me sane, and helped me find much fulfillment and joy in life. I could write paragraphs, but my committee might murder me for spending 20 pages on the acknowledgments.  

To Scarlet, thank you for these 13 years. You are the one who has made me who I am, who kept me going all those late nights, who kept my creativity alive, who made me look forward to tomorrow.  (And I also haven't forgotten all the hours you spent helping me with proofreading, data, and stimuli for many different papers.) I dedicate all of my success to you. 

Of course, a monumental thanks to Mom and Dad.  I would not even have had the opportunity to challenge myself if it wasn’t for your care and unwavering support no matter what career (or hobby) I dabbled in. Thank you for all these years of love.

The final thanks (perhaps surprisingly, even to the individual in question) goes to Douglas. I don't think you (or I) can ever quantify how much of what I've been able to achieve has been because I have you as an outstanding (slightly insane detail-oriented) brother, going out of your way to make my journey smoother.  And for the record, your cooking is the best.
